# Blackfire.io

[Blackfire.io](https://blackfire.io) is the preferred way by amazee.io to profile your Drupal sites. Over are the times to handle clunky weird xhprof configurations and other things.

At amazee.io we ship Blackfire with every Local Drupal Development site and it is enabled on all development and production sites.

It is easily configured and setup:

## Initial Setup

1. In order to use Blackfire.io you need an Blackfire.io account, which is completely free! [Create one right now.](https://blackfire.io/signup)
2. Visit [your Blackfire.io account](https://blackfire.io/account) and copy the `Server ID` and `Server Token` from the _My Server Credentials_ section \(not the _My Client Credentials_ section!\)

## Local Docker Development with Blackfire Chrome Companion

1. Install the [Blackfire Chrome Companion](https://blackfire.io/docs/integrations/chrome)
2. Find the commented Blackfire section inside your `docker-compose.yml` file \(see an example [here](https://github.com/amazeeio/docker/blob/master/example-php70-basic.yml#L13)\)
3. Uncomment the lines `BLACKFIRE_SERVER_ID` and `BLACKFIRE_SERVER_TOKEN` and add the  information from your Blackfire.io account. Example:

        services:
          drupal:
            hostname: &hostname mysite.docker.amazee.io
            environment:
              BLACKFIRE_SERVER_ID: bdda64f6-7c4f-4ec5-be32-f1a6f5680cb0
              BLACKFIRE_SERVER_TOKEN: fcc9ec9e54ffb4a35a5fcf7376f462eb85fe47e9fc978ed1df067c8b82afe500

4. restart your Docker container if it is running:

        docker-compose up -d --force-recreate

5. Visit your local Docker site \(in this example http://mysite.docker.amazee.io\)

6. Click on the Blackfire Chrome Companion Icon, select "Profile" and after a couple of seconds you will have local site profiled.

7. Read more at [Analyzing Profiles](https://blackfire.io/docs/reference-guide/analyzing-profiles) about the Profiles that Blackfire generates.


## Local Docker Development with `blackfire` CLI tool

Every amazee.io Docker image has the `blackfire` CLI tool already installed, so you can use that instead of the Chrome Companion. Learn more about the profiling of HTTP Request at the [Blackfire documentation](https://blackfire.io/docs/cookbooks/profiling-http).

1. Follow Steps 2-4 from _Local Docker Development with Blackfire Chrome Companion_
2. Connect to the Docker Container
3. Run the `blackfire` command with defining the client-id and client-token from your [your Blackfire.io account](https://blackfire.io/account), example:
  ```
  blackfire --client-id="5f12d5ef-5b63-4d16-9bd8-2c741fe6a3ed" --client-token="13210acce473f9d8f485f19088f8b0b83c03bc2938efface72b9de1506ed211d" curl http://mysite.docker.amazee.io/
  ```


## Development and Production sites

One of the greatness of Blackfire is the capability to profile on development and production sites without harm. This is possible as each request from a Blackfire client is authenticated via the Client-ID and the Client-Token and ensured that this client has the authority to profile a specific site. Plus the Blackfire PHP module does nothing when you are not profiling, so it does not add any overhead to a regular request.

In order to profile your development or production sites, just pass the amazee.io team your `Server ID` and `Server Token` from your [Blackfire.io account,](https://blackfire.io/account) we will then deploy these keys to all your sites and you can start to profile in no time!

## Triggering Blackfire Scenarios after deployments

Another great feature of Blackfire: You can profile and test fully automatically without you needing to do anything. Blackfire will tell you exactly if a deployment made your site faster or slower! This is an Enterprise feature only though, but they are worth the price, never has been automated profiling been easier. [Talk to us](/mailto:support@amazee.io) if you are interested in a discount on Blackfire Enterprise!

Blackfire calls them Scenarios and they are based on Tests. Read more about them [over at the Blackfire docs](https://blackfire.io/docs/cookbooks/scenarios). After you have defined your Tests and Scenarios, you need to trigger them after a deployment. This happens within the `.amazeeio.yml` file within a deploy task.

The best practice is to add them add the last step within the `after_deploy` task list. Please see the [Trigger API documentation](https://blackfire.io/docs/reference-guide/builds-and-integrations#start-build-with-api) from Blackfire on how to call a trigger via curl or the blackfire tool \(which is also installed on all development and production sites\).

Hint hint: the API needs to know the URL of the site to test via the `endpoint` parameter, we provide you the `AMAZEEIO_BASE_URL` environment variable which contains exactly that.
